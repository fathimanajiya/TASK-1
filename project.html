            <li><h3>CLOUD COMPUTING</h3></li>
            <p>
                In the virtual and widely distributed network, the process of handover sensitive data from the distributer to the clients alwats occur regularly in this modern world.So it needs to safeguard the security and durability of service based on the denand of users.This project oresents a data leakage detection system using various allocation strategies.For secure transactions, allowing only authorized users to access sensitive data through access control policies shall prevent data leakage by sharing information only with trusted usres and also the data should be detected from leakage by means of adding fake records in the data set which improves probability of identifying leakages in the system. then, finally it is decided to implement this mechanism on a cloud server.
