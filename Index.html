            My name is Fathima Najiya ,1st Computer Science and engineering student in College of Engineering, Vadakara. I took my IEEE membership on December 2020 and from that day onwards I started to utilise the resources of IEEE. Back then our college student branch, IEEE SB CEV had conducted many events for CEV freshers by department wise and I got the overall best performer award in CS department. It was my 1st award from IEEE. Followed by this I got many 1st prizes from different evevts conducted by different SBs, and out of these the most memorable ones are the 1st prizes I got from the Quiz competitions conducted by IEEE CS Kerala Chapter and IEEE LINK Kerala Chapter.
            I also got a chance to mentor on the basics of C-language,conducted as a part of SHE ALLIANCE by IEEE WIE AG CEV.
            At present am also the content writer of IEEE SB CEV.
